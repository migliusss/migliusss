## 🦋 About me
  I’m an IT student at University of Sørøst Norway. I have started studying in 2022, which means I’m pretty new in programming.

  I have taken courses in HTML and CSS and started to learn JavaScript. In university I am learning OOP with Java, 
  and also taken a course in SQL and Database Administration. 

  I have a huge interest in learning how programs work and have a goal to be able to develope them myself. 
  I wish to develop interfaces that are accesible to everyone, and are user friendly. 

## 🐥 Currently Learning

  - Java.
  - JavaScript.
