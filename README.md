## 🦋 About me
  I’m an IT student at University of Sørøst Norway. I have started my IT journey in 2022, which means I’m pretty new in programming and web development.

  I have taken courses in HTML and CSS and wish to start learning JavaScript in the near future. 

  I wish to develop user friendly interfaces with pleasant design. 

## 🐥 Currently Learning

  - Java.
  - SQL.
